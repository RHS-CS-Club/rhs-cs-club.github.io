We are Rochester High School's CS Club!

We are a group of curious and devoted CS enthusiasts who work on building new projects every week!

This site's source code can be found [here][source-code]

This website is still in development and maybe changed to a Reactjs website as Zayn learns more about it.

Have a great day!
