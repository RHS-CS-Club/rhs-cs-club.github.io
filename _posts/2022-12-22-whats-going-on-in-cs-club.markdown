In our first semester as Rochester High School's CS Club, we have made some pretty cool stuff.

### Personal Websites
In an introductory meeting, members of CS Club made their own websites to talk a little bit about themselves and some projects they have made. Check them out!
- Zayn B.'s Website: [imzaynb.github.io][zayns-website]
  - I tried to make an aesthetic looking website that could form a portfolio of all the cool stuff I am a part of!
- Ryan J.'s Website: [ryandagamer.github.io][ryans-website]
- Devin B.'s Website: [wevisdev.github.io][devins-website]
- Brooks B.'s Website: [totallythefrdrizzy.github.io][brooks-website]
- Luis R.'s Cool Scratch Project: [scratch project!][luis-scratch]
